# Sail
Sail needs node.js to be able to run properly.

If you have node installed, run the "Install-Libs" batch file, to install all the libraries.

After that, configure your configuration json with your token, and other configurations.

Then finally, run the "Run" batch file, to start the program, if ran properly this should work perfectly fine!

The starter prefix is ">" which can be modified within the code!
